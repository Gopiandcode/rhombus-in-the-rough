*** Has value representing action
** TODO Add interaction system
*** TODO for entity with interaction and position, if distance from player is less than n, show interaction dialog
** TODO Add dialog box (non ECS)
* TODO Add dialog writing lang
** P1: .... P2: ..... Choice: ..... Narrator: .....
* TODO Add map description lang
* TODO Add item/inventory description lang
* TODO Add multiple worlds
* TODO Add enemies description lang
* TODO Add quest description lang
* Writing a contextual action button
** Add a interactable component that has a sprite, and offset
** Add an interaction system, that iterates through entities with interactable, and if user nearby, shows the interaction sprite
** If the user is nearby and user presses action, then add ActiveInteraction() component to entity
** For each interaction that you want to support, add a component with extra details and add system to handle entities with ActiveInteraction
** For example, to have a basic dialog system to NPCs (we'll extend later), add ConversationContent(sprite,text) component, and system, when given activeinteraction and conversation text, changes the game state to dialog mode with the text
