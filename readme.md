# A Rhombus in the Rough: Adventure Awaits!

This is a small libre RPG game built using the Rhombus programming
language & Raylib, licensed under AGPLv3+.



The artwork for the game is based on submissions for the Libre Pixel Cup,
all under libre licenses, and the specific attribution is given in the
[attribution document](./attribution.md). 

If you think this looks cool, or want to find out more, or just
anything (please, I'm desperate), drop me a message, let me know! I'd
love to collaborate!

## Stuff for PL Nerds

From a programming languages standpoint, if you're into that, this
project showcases the ease of writing macros and building DSLs in
Rhombus (a particular lang on top of Racket), and contains several
specialised DSLs for various parts of the game.

Some interesting DSLs in the project:
